15. Copy the path of the file and place it in `.env` under `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="Path/To/File.json`

### MongoDB
MongoDB is required to run the backend server. There are multiple ways to do this.

1. Locally using docker to download and run a MongoDB container.

https://www.docker.com/

https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo 

2. Download and install mongoDB locally on your computer - Use the MongoDB Community Server download.

3. Create a free DB online using MongoDB Atlas (Links below)

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Run App

```bash
npm run server
```

## Test App
Testing of the app is done using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
Ensure you have run `npm install` before anything else.

All tests are to be located in the `/test` folder and separated by their files folder. An example of this is if we are writing tests for the `/src/controllers/user-controller.ts` file then the equivalent test file would be `/test/conrollers/user-controller.ts`. Some exceptions can be made for folders that only contain one piece of code such as `/src/config/database-config.ts` and `/src/utils/generate-token.ts` which can be placed in the `/test` folder.

Tests are to be written with the [AAA pattern](https://medium.com/@pjbgf/title-testing-code-ocd-and-the-aaa-pattern-df453975ab80) (Arrange, Act, Assert).

It is prefered to use nested [`describe()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#describename-fn) functions where the main `describe()` distinguishes the file being tested, and the nested `describe()` distinguishes the function being tested.

Tests are written using [`test(Case: Description of what should happen)`](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#testname-fn-timeout) rather than using `it(Should do this)` for clarity reasons.

To run the tests simply run
```bash
npm run test
```
and monitor the console for the test results.

For more in depth test debugging and running it is recommended to use the [Jest Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kavod-io.vscode-jest-test-adapter) VSCode extention or similar.
